 ## Global Economic Indicators-A visual exploration of National Accounts data

ABOUT THE DATASET:
The National Accounts Main Aggregates Database is a significant dataset in data visualization because it provides a comprehensive and standardized source of data on the economic performance of countries and areas around the world. The database includes data on a wide range of economic indicators, including gross domestic product (GDP), government spending, investment, and personal consumption. I chose this topic because I am interested in understanding the economic performance of different countries and areas around the world, and I believe that data visualization is a powerful tool for communicating complex information in a clear and concise way. I believe that understanding economic data is crucial for informed decision-making. The National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, spanning over 200 countries from 1970 onwards, offers a comprehensive view of economic trends. I chose this topic to unravel the stories hidden within the numbers, providing a visually compelling narrative of the world's economic evolution.<BR>

Process:<BR>
<B>Idea</B>: I started by brainstorming a list of potential topics related to the global economy. I then narrowed down this list to a few topics that I found particularly interesting and that I thought would be relevant to a wide audience.<br>
<b>Data selection</b>: Once I had chosen a topic, I began to look for data that I could use to create my visualizations. I used the National Accounts Main Aggregates Database from the United Nations Statistics Division, which contains data on a variety of economic indicators for over 200 countries and areas of the world.<br>
<b>Refinement</b>: Once I had collected my data, I began to refine my visualizations. I experimented with different graph types and data aggregation methods to create visualizations that were both informative and visually appealing.<br>
<br>
Graph Types Chosen and Why:<br>
Global Economic Trends Over Time (Line Graph):<br>
1. Line graph to illustrate the trends in GNI and GDP over multiple years for each country : Line graphs are effective in showing continuous data trends over time.<br>
2. Side-by-side circle chart : It serves the purpose of visually comparing the Per Capita GNI of different countries from 2000 to 2021. This visualization choice aligns with the specific nature of the data and the insights sought after, providing a clear and concise representation of economic well-being across nations over time.<br>
<br>
3. Imports Treemap : Utilized a treemap to visually represent the proportion of imports for different countries. Treemaps are excellent for displaying hierarchical data and the relative size of categories.<br>
<br>
4. Map for Global Comparison of Economic Factors: Employed a map to compare economic factors across countries. Maps provide a geographical context, allowing for easy identification of regional patterns.<br>
<br>
5. Stacked Area Chart for GDP Components Over Time: Opted for a stacked area chart to showcase the composition of GDP components over the years. Stacked area charts effectively display the cumulative contribution of different variables.<br>
<br>
6. Line Chart for Population Growth Over Time: Selected a line chart to visualize the growth trends in population over the years. Line charts are ideal for representing trends and patterns in continuous data.<br>
<br>
7. Scatterplot of Changes in Inventories Over Time: Utilized a scatterplot to explore the relationship between changes in inventories and time. Scatterplots help identify correlations and trends in paired data.<br>
<br>
8. Global Economic Development Bubble Chart: Implemented a bubble chart to compare GNI, GDP, and another economic indicator across countries. Bubble charts efficiently represent three dimensions of data.<br>
